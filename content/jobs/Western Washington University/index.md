- As manager of the language lab, I was in charge of the technology that students used for linguistic research. I also facilitated several 'crash courses' on various languages that faculty spoke, including Hungarian, Mongolian, Tibetan, Hawaiian, Swedish, and Lushootseed. I also converted language learning resources to various formats and edited videos from the Linguistics program archives.
