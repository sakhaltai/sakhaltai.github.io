[Guardian Robotics](https://www.guardianrobotics.com/) makes security drones designed to disarm active shooters using tear gas and defensive maneuvers. A slightly dystopian piece, it was still a fun challenge to create isometric perspective in After Effects, combined with 3D elements made in Element3D, Andrew Kramer's native 3D plugin for After Effects.
