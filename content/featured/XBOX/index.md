The [XBOX](https://www.xbox.com/en-US) Team at Microsoft tasked us with making explainer motion graphics for each of their audience segmentations. All characters are animated without puppet tool or any plugins. Just straight up animated paths. Later we integrated [Joysticks N' Sliders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMznIbcTZjc) to control repeated character movements, because we're not hedonists lol.
