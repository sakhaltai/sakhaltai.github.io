An explainer motion graphic for [Nuclear Threat Initiative](https://www.nti.org/) on the dangers of Amateur ['Benchtop' DNA Synthesis](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/benchtop-dna-synthesis-devices-capabilities-biosecurity-implications-and-governance/). Lots of gritty textures, noise and turbulence-displaced vfx, photos/videos overlaid on vector assets, narrative-driven animation.
