[Knights Who Say Nah](https://www.knightssaynah.com) contacted my friend and I to make some 'win/lose' scenario videos for their NFT minting minigame. We had never animated in Unreal Engine, but we made everything from 3D assets to Control/IK rigs, animation blueprints, materials, textures, shaders, procedural vfx, particle systems--you name it. One of the most challenging and fun projects to date. We made separate sprites and environments for the Viking Warrior, Greek Warrior, Samurai Warrior, and Medieval Knight teasers.
