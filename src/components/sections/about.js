              Hello! My name is Nic and I'm a linguistics enthusiast, devoted father, passionate
              educator, and a 10-year veteran of the motion design industry. In 2010, I graduated
              from <a href="https://www.wwu.edu/">Western Washington University</a>, with a degree
              in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics">Linguistics</a>, a bunch of
              student debt, and no plan at all. After some rather unpleasant but character-building
              years as a nail polish inventory manager, a vitamin shipper, and a valet, I took a
              2-month intensive dive into the world of{' '}
              <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html">After Effects</a>, and
              managed to land myself an internship at a local boutique design shop,{' '}
              <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/killer-infographics">
                Killer Infographics

              .
            </p>
            <p>
              One year later I was a full-time motion designer, then a senior motion designer, then
              the Director of Education, overseeing continuing education, holding workshops on After
              Effects, hiring interns and mentoring students, and pioneering our first ever passion
              project initiative. Every one of my interns was hired in the design industry after
              completing their internships, and many of them were hired by our own company! The high
              school students I mentored went on to study at prestigious art programs around the
              world.
              {/* I managed to weather the storm of multiple acquisitions and mergers from 2021 onward, until June of 2023 when the motion department was effectively shut down. */}
            </p>
            <p>
              Around the same time, I was hired by Shoreline Community College to teach an Intro to
              After Effects class, as well as a Specializations class where students could pursue a
              topic of their choice for an entire quarter. My After Effects students went from
              complete novices to hireable motion designers in a matter of months, and I'm pleased
              to say{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              I've worked in all phases of the motion design pipeline, including scripting,
              storyboarding, asset creation, voiceover recording, sound editing, animation, video
              editing, and project &amp; client management. So there ya have it. I've worked for a{' '}
